## Tasks :
- [ ] Main Task
  - [ ] Classification : 
    - For each of the classes predict the presence/absence of at least one object of that class in a test image.
  - [ ] Detection : 
    - For each of the classes predict the bounding boxes of each object of that class in a test image (if any).
  - [ ] Segmentation : 
    - For each pixel in a test image, predict the class of the object containing that pixel or ‘background’ if the pixel does not belong to one of the twenty specified classes.
  - [ ] Action Classification 
  - [ ] Large Scale Recognition 
- [ ] Additional “taster” Task
  - [ ] Boxless Action Classification 
  - [ ] Person Layout
